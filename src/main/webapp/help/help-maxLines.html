<div>
  <p>The maximum number of log lines to send to Logstash.<br/>
  If the log is bigger than this, only the most recent lines are sent.<br/>
  0 indicates to send no log, basically just the job data is sent.<br/>
  -1 indicates there is no maximum (for very large logs, consider using the Logstash Job Property instead).<br/>
  </p>
