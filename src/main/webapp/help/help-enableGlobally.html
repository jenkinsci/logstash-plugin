<div>
Allows to enable the upload globally for all jobs. If jobs explicitly configure uploading this will overwrite the settings defined here.<br/>
E.g. you enable the notifier mode globally, a project defines the line mode, the logs will be uploaded in line mode only.
<ul>
 <li>OFF:<br/>
  Do not send log for each build.</li>
  <li>Line Mode:<br/>
  Enable sending an event for each log line. This will not enable it for pipeline jobs.
  </li>
  <li>
  Notifier Mode:<br/>
  Enable sending the log at the end of the build in a single event.<br/>
  This will never fail the build even when uploading fails.
  </li>
</ul>
